# WeekWise - An AI-Powered Weekly Planner

WeekWise is a modern, offline-first, and AI-enhanced weekly planner built with Next.js and Firebase. It's designed to help you organize your tasks and notes efficiently, with intelligent features to make planning easier.

This project was built inside Firebase Studio, an AI-powered IDE for building and deploying web applications on Google Cloud.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, you'll first need a Firebase project.

### 1. Firebase Setup

1.  Create a new project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  In your new project, go to **Authentication** -> **Sign-in method** and enable `Email/Password` and `Google` as providers.
3.  Go to **Firestore Database** and create a new database. Start in `production mode`.
4.  Go to **Project Settings** (click the gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è) and under the "General" tab, find your "Web app" and its configuration.

### 2. Local Setup

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Run the application in development mode:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  Open your browser to `http://localhost:9002/setup`.
5.  Paste the entire Firebase config object from your Firebase project settings into the text area and save. This will store your configuration securely in your browser's local storage.
6.  You will be redirected to the login page, where you can now sign up and start using the app.

### 3. IMPORTANT: Create a Firestore Index for Performance

The application's performance relies on a specific Firestore index. **Without it, the app will be very slow to load tasks.** You must create this index in your Firebase project. You can do this in two ways:

#### Option A: Deploy via Firebase CLI (Recommended)

This is the fastest method. First, you need to install the Firebase CLI:
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

Then, log in to Firebase:
```bash
firebase login
```

Finally, from your project directory, deploy the Firestore indexes:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

This command will read the `firestore.indexes.json` file and create the necessary index in your Firebase project. Index creation can take a few minutes.

#### Option B: Create the Index in the Web Console

If you prefer not to use the CLI, you can create the index manually in the Firebase Console:

1.  Go to your **Firebase project**.
2.  In the left-hand menu, under `Build`, click on **Firestore Database**.
3.  Go to the **Indexes** tab at the top.
4.  Click on the **Single field** tab.
5.  In the "Add exemption" dialog that appears, set the following fields:
    *   **Collection ID:** `tasks`
    *   **Field path:** `createdAt`
    *   Under **Configuration**, check the box for **Descending** ordering.
    *   Make sure **Array** is unchecked.
6.  Click **Save**.

The index will start building and may take a few minutes to become active.

## üì¶ Deployment

To create a production-ready version of your application, you can run the build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command compiles the application and optimizes it for performance. The output will be in the `.next` directory. You can then deploy this directory to any hosting service that supports Next.js, such as Firebase App Hosting or Vercel.

If you want to create a zip file of the project to share, you can run this command after the build (on macOS/Linux):

```bash
zip -r WeekWise.zip . -x ".next/*" "node_modules/*" ".DS_Store"
```

This will create a `WeekWise.zip` file with all your project code, excluding the large build and dependency folders.
